<div class="about"><h2 class="about-heading">Texas Assistive Devices, LLC</h2><p class="indent">Texas Assistive Devices originally developed the Hayden-Preston System (HPS). It was the only interchangeable prosthetic tool system in the world at the time that featured a terminal device with a pitch adjustment of 60° including 360° rotation. The universal push-button quick insert-release terminal device was capable of utilizing a wide selection of custom designed and crafted interchangeable tools and implements. Because of the HPS's unique design, it allowed the user to perform jobs, chores and duties that he or she would be unable to do otherwise without an assistant.</p><h2 class="quote-one">"... it allowed the user to perform jobs, chores and duties that he or she would be unable to do otherwise without an assistant."</h2><p>But what exactly makes the Hayden-Preston System the product of choice? Let's take a look. A Tried and Proven System. Utilizing this specialized terminal device with its unique tool adaptation, the HPS provides a versatility, flexibility and safety index unattainable with conventional terminal devices. It has received positive feedback from all healthcare providers witnessing the HPS demonstration. In fact, The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) in Houston, Texas has included the HPS in their Occupational Therapy Program since 1994. The HPS is Workers’ Compensation and prescription approved. In 1996, Northwestern University Rehabilitation Engineering and Prosthetics Orthotic Center received the HPS for examination and demonstrated the HPS at several educational presentations. The Ne aska Agr-Ability Project displayed the HPS at the 1997 Ne aska State Fair. Texas Assistive Devices, LLC is a qualified vendor to the Texas Rehabilitation Commission.</p><p class="indent">Texas Assistive Devices has a reputation of listening very carefully to patient needs, and to practitioner and therapist suggestions. Their feedback led to the development of the N-Abler line of products. The Hayden-Preston System now offers three major products: the N - Abler I (our original terminal device), N-Abler II (our new terminal device design), and the N-Abler III. The N-Abler III was developed to assist non-amputees who do have some arm function, but little or no hand function resulting from spinal cord injuries, nerve or muscle damage, birth defects, stroke, etc. Our newest products to be developed are a Three-Zone Hands Free Tool Changing Station and the Quick Disconnect Myo-Electric Wrist Adapter. The Quick Disconnect Myo-Electric Wrist Adapter provides a platform for Myo users to easily switch from the Myo hand to a conventional terminal device such as a hook or the N-Abler II. Our mission is to become the world’s leading provider of devices designed to assist persons with upper extremity amputation and hand dysfunction.</p><p>Our mission is to become the world’s leading provider of devices designed to assist persons with upper extremity amputation and hand dysfunction.</p><h2 class="quote-two">"Our mission is to become the world’s leading provider of devices designed to assist persons with upper extremity amputation and hand dysfunction."</h2><div class="author"><p>Ron Farquharson</p><p>Manufacturing President</p><p>Texas Assistive Devices, L.L.C.</p></div></div>
